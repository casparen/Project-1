# Project-1

### Synopsis
For my first game I decided to build a game that uses German voice recognition, and test their abilities to pronounce German words. Teaching the players German words through a game. 
The second game, is based of the game catch. The user controls a small ball with the arrow keys and has to try to collide with the automated ball that is bouncing around in a contained space.

### How it works
The players press the little circles to start the game. Once the button is pressed a timer counts down and they have to try to say the words that show up. It takes about three seconds for the API to recognize the voice, it recognized the player receives a point and the word is rewritten in capitalized letters. 

### Motivation
My motivation for this game was to teach foreign words, in a fun way.

### API Reference
I used an API called annyang, that allows for multiple language voice recognition. https://github.com/TalAter/annyang/blob/master/docs/README.md

### Process 
I started off with sketching, mind mapping, and brain storming ideas. After closing down on two ideas, I moved onto writing peuseodo code, and figuring out the general structure. I found an API called annyang that allowed me to incorporate voice recognition into my game.
